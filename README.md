This branch hosts the "API" (lol just some read-only files) for Loadson, consisting of latest compiled binaries, version checking, dirtree and hashmap.<br>
If you wish to install Loadson, go to the Releases page.<br>
There is also an md5 calculator included in the files that prints all the cwd files' md5 in the console
